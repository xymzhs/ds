algorithms is the sets of steps that will solve specific problems for us

## Time and Space Complexities

When we speak about algorithms we normally use such metrics as time
complexity (how much time the algorithm requires to solve a problem) and space complexity (how
much memory the algorithm requires to solve a problem). These two metrics need to be evaluating
to make a decision of which algorithm is better.

## Big O Notation

so big O notation is a more formal mathematical way express the values of time and space complexities.
