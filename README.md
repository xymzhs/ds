## Time and Space Complexities

algorithms is the sets of steps that will solve specific problems for us
When we speak about algorithms we normally use such metrics as time complexity (how much time the algorithm requires to solve a problem) and space complexity (how
much memory the algorithm requires to solve a problem). These two metrics need to be evaluating to make a decision of which algorithm is better.

## Big O Notation

Big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space
requirements grow as the input size grows.

The key here is that Big O notation is a relative metric that shows how fast execution time of the algorithm or its consumed memory will grow depending on input size growth.
Absolute values of time and memory vary on different hardware so we need to use a relative metric.

The same program may be executed in 1 second on one computer and in 10 seconds on another
one. Thus when you compare time complexities of two algorithms it is required for them to be running on the same predefined hardware configuration which is not convenient and sometimes is not reproducible.
